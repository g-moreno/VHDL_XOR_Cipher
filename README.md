# VHDL_XOR_Cipher
This project aims to implement a simple XOR cipher on the Zybo Z7 FPGA development board. The XOR cipher is a basic cryptographic technique where each byte of the plaintext is XOR with a corresponding byte of the key to produce the ciphertext. This method is symmetric, meaning the same process is used for both encryption and decryption.
